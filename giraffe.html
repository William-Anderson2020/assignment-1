          The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus <i>Giraffa</i>. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
          Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, <i>Giraffa camelopardalis</i>, with nine subspecies. 
          Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. 
          Seven other extinct species of <i>Giraffa</i> are known from the fossil record.
